# BMIG 5003 Fall 2023

## What you have learned?

We covered all the topics described on the syllabus with different level of detail.


+ Finite State Machines
+ Bayesian Networks
+ Machine Learning
+ Natural Language Processing

+ Rule-based reasoning

But we add more to it

+ Basic Probability
+ Bayesian Thinking
+ Hidden Markov Models
+ Neural Networks
+ Markov models
+ Computing Engineering
+ Fundamentals of Computation
+ Using Repositories
+ BASH and shell programming
+ Cloud and HPC

Above all, we explore a lot of coding in Python. 

## What do you do after this?

The decision of using Python as an example for imperative programming was necessary. 
Not because Python is good at everything, but serve us as a guide that we can build upon.

This is not the end but the beginning of your coding journey and depends heavily on your area of interest in biomedical informatics.

Here are my recommendations.

+ Bioinformatics. 
    + You need to get into BASH programming and the interaction between Python and BASH.
    + HPC knowledge is a must.
    + Cloud computing is also a good asset as most of the big data centers for genomics have already connections with AWS or Google. 
+ Clinical Informatics. 
    + Expert Systems. I will get into LISP programming and a tool like CLIPS. Keep on mind that it is not the main stream nowadays.
    + Data Analytics. Classic Machine Learning methods will require some familiarity with R. 
    + Bayesian Networks. This topic is better covered in R, but it will require sometime to get familiar with the Statistical background required.
    + NLP. New methodologies are based in deep learning and *large language models* (yes, that means GTP) 
+ Imaging Informatics.
    + Deep learning. Python is the lingua franca in deep learning, but the details of how to properly use it for ML requires more math and stats to apply it properly.
    + GPUs usage is a must. Thus, it is required to get an account in a properly setup HPC.

## Learning another computing program.

It is always a good idea to practice a different language. It makes you a better programmer in general, since you will be forced to compare and swap between those languages. 

+ R is highly recommended.
+ Julia if you are interested in making faster algorithms.
+ LISP if you are interested in "old-fashioned" AI (very powerful)
+ SPARK if you really want to get into SQL on steroids. 
+ Matlab is recommended for some specific areas (for instance neuroinformatics).
+ Mathematica is problably the most obscure but powerful system. 
+ Typescript (or Javascript) these programs seem to have a very active audience. My favorite graph engine *plotly* has the best documentation for python and javascript. 


## Last but not least

Please take some time to work on the course evaluation. I need your input!
